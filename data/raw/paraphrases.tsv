E05107	It seems like a no-brainer to say something like this, but actually the way we handle soil needs to change massively to halt and mitigate the climate crisis and its consequences. Thus, we need to rehabilitate and restore abandoned and contaminated places and shift agriculture to regenerative agriculture or restoration agriculture. We need to stabilize family farms and make them ecologically, financially and socially sustainable. This all depends on a lot of labor, engaged people and legal and conceptual infrastructure.

In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and hopefully appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.

E07264	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides, and as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are constantly splitting work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be given to the media, as the EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.

E07277	The EU must both promote and uphold the highest social and environmental standards in its internal as well as external policies. Human rights and collective agreements must never be seen as barriers to trade!

E08003	I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that the question of the command of this army must also be resolved, and here the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.

E08004	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction, so NGOs and development cooperation must be involved, and an army that can fight must also be able to build, I would also like an army of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army, also taking into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objections, as in the German army.

E08005	Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense, if conscription is introduced at European level, the army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey and China.

E08008	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army but would tie it to a reform of the European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.

E08009	I agree with your idea but it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal : What is the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that is: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.

E08016	On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand we have the reluctant United States that switches between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years, and I stand convinced that for the European Union to move forward, it must introduce measures for the security of both current member states as well as future member states that are threatened by foreign aggression and take the responsibility of continental security into our own hands.
